# Summary


Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organizer of this year’s Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival. 

"Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival" just got the approval to show movies at Brooklyn Bridge Park this year from August 5th through 8th, from 6pm to midnight. 
They need to publicize the festival, and to do this, They need a website. On this site, They need to display information about the festival, the films they're showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival.
There should also be links to the city of Brooklyn’s news website, the Brooklyn Bridge Park’s website, and there Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts somewhere on the page (navigation bar, footer links, etc). 
Shows will be free and open to everyone, but They want people to be able to pre-register so that they are able to estimate how many people might come and so that they can close registration if it reaches the venue’s capacity of 5,000 people.
They'd like to have a professional web address, either a .com or .org.
